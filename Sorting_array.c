/*
Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. It is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case time complexity is quite high 1.

Hereâ€™s how the algorithm works:

The algorithm traverses the array from left to right and compares adjacent elements.
If the left element is greater than the right element, the two elements are swapped.
This process is repeated until the array is sorted.
